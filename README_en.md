## Overview
Debugx is a debugging plugin specifically developed for the Unity engine.  
Used to manage DebugLog by debugging members and output log files locally. Use the macro "DEBUG_X" to enable functionality.

Use Debugx.Log() directly in your code for easy log printing.  
Different members use different keys, allowing convenient categorized printing by member and quick identification of corresponding code owners.

In Unity DOTS Burst environment, you must use DebugxBurst instead of Debugx, as many methods and fields are unavailable in Burst.  
However, since Unity DOTS updates very frequently, this method cannot guarantee complete reliability across different DOTS versions.
